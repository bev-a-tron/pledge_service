# Lessig2016


We're trying a different architecture on GAE.

## HELP NEEDED!

## Design sketch


The majority of the site is just basic static content, as it should
be. That markup lives in "markup/" in the form of jade files. If you
don't know what those are, they're very simple, and remove literally
50% of HTML's boilerplate so they're worth it. Read the 3 minute
tutorial.

Stylesheets are in "stylesheets/" as sass files. See last paragraph
for why that's good.

Ideally there will be little enough JS that no framework will be necessary (fingers crossed).

The backend will be very simple with two endpoints

1. Pledge. This has to be done in coordination with stripe so that stripe stores the credit card info, and we only store an opaque token and the pledge amount. This will write to what'll be probably the only table in the datastore.
2. GetTotal: Simple sum over pledges. Store it in memcache, expire every few minutes. Boom.

## Dependencies

* Python App Engine SDK
* NPM
* sass (with ruby installed, `gem install sass`)

## Hacking

After checking out the code, run `npm install`. To start the server, run `npm start` and go to
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). That's it!

If you want to rapidly set up a development environment that already has npm and
dependencies installed using [docker](https://www.docker.io/), try running

```
docker run -t -i -v /path/to/checkout:/develop jtolds/mayone-gae /bin/bash
```

Then in that new shell

```
stunnel4 /etc/stunnel/https.conf
cd /develop
npm install
npm start
```

### Running Tests

After running `npm install` and `grunt local`, copy `build/config.json` over to `backend/` and run
`python testrunner.py` in the project's root directory.


## Deploying

We have 4 deployment environments available, all of which can be set up with grunt (installed by npm).
* **local**: For normal development, with code updates on every reload. Run `npm start` or equivalently `node_modules/.bin/grunt local`.
  * Note that in local mode, you can't actually send a transaction to stripe due to an SSL bug in dev_appserver. But
    you can get right up to that point before it fails, which is generally good enough.
* **dev**: This is an independant instance of the app running at https://pure-spring-568.appspot.com. We can do
  whatever we want here because the data's all fake. It also uses Stripe's test keys, so feel free to submit test
  transactions with credit card 4242 4242 4242 4242. To deploy, run `./node_modules/.bin/grunt dev`, and then
  `appcfg.py --oauth2 update build/`.
  When testing, it works best to hit this URL: https://pledgedev.mayday.us/pledge.
* **staging**: This is the real app, but a separate version that's available at https://staging-dot-mayday-pac.appspot.com/.
  Notably, it uses the same datastore as prod, and the real stripe keys. Any code that touches
  the data should be deployed here with caution, but if not, you can be a little lax since real
  traffic doesn't hit it. To deploy, run `./node_modules/.bin/grunt staging`, and then
  `appcfg.py --oauth2 update build/`.
* **prod**: The real McCoy. Don't break it. To deploy, run `./node_modules/.bin/grunt prod`, and then
  `appcfg.py --oauth2 update build/`.

We don't have much in the way of release procedures, so it just comes down to how paranoid you want to be.
Some changes can go straight to prod. Some should go through dev first. Some through both dev and staging
before prod. App Engine even allows you do to traffic splitting, so we could theoretically send N% of
queries to staging if we're really paranoid about something. Use good judgement and run it by team memebers
if you're unsure.

If you're pushing to prod, please tag the commit you're pushing with the next available "v1,v2,v3,..." tag,
and remember to git push --tags. That way if we need to roll back we have a sense of what used to be in
production.


## Troubleshooting

If `npm start` generates an out of files error and prints a lot of messages like this:

    Warning: EMFILE: Too many opened files.

You probably have an orphan app engine process running. Try looking for and
killing any child processes. Worst case, you may need to increase your inotify
maximums; you can do that on a Linux system with this command:

    echo 1024 > /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances
# pledge_service
