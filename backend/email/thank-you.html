<p>Dear {name},</p>

<p>Thank you for your donation to my campaign for president. None of this would be possible without your support.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning. With your help, we will reach voters across the country who care about citizen equality. The 2016 presidential election will become a referendum â€” and a mandate for real reform.</p>

<p>We appreciate your generous contribution. This is a people-powered campaign, so please be sure to tell your friends and family members about what is at stake and how they can get involved.</p>

<p>With gratitude,</p>

<p>
   --Lessig<br/>
